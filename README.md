# Game demo

Hiii, im SamKerubin, better know just as "Sam". 

Im a starter game developer and this is basically my _second_ project made in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) :3

To be honest, i dont have any formal experience at programming or developing games at all, im at 2nd year of Computer Science in a university from Colombia

As i previously said, this is nothing too special. Im making a videogame demo inspired by [The Binding of Isaac](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjn9a_6rL-MAxW2SjABHdz7MSYQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1426300%2FThe_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance%2F&usg=AOvVaw0qATi51F3D11lP23HxvLzx&opi=89978449)
by _Edmund McMillen_.

## Why are you making this?

Well, im actually working on another videogame thats called "_Desidia_". Desidia its an 2D RPG videogame with tons of inspirations like [SAO first season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online_season_1), 
[Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en), and many other videogames _(and also some cultures)_.

Im making this demo to make me and my team at least a little recognized between the developer comunity.

## Will you finish the development of this game?

_Maybe_... I dont have a clear idea right now of what i want to do with this game, im just happy creating something inspired by one of my favorite games of all time.

## Well but... What about Desidia? When its comming out?

At the date of this commit: **04/04/2025**, we expect to launch a demo version of Desidia in **04/20/2025**
The full game... its hard to tell when is comming out... Why?... We are putting all our effort on making the best RPG experience, with procedural maps, 
NPCs and enemies with advances algorithms of AI
